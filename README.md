# Weather app
It's just a simple app that displays weather either based on your location, or a city you add in manually.


## Running
It needs an OpenWeatherMap api key to running. To add your own create a "apikey.properties" file
and add your apikey there like
```
WEATHER_API_KEY=*
```
Replace the "*" in it with your api key.
